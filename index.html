    <h2>About Timeline</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Let’s be honest, when you think about geological timelines do you picture dinosaurs grazing in an ancient valley with 
        giant volcanoes erupting in the background? Do you picture Cavemen in deer-skinned onesies, hurling Spears at wooly 
        mammoths? It's OK, me too. I'm not saying that those things are not a part of it, but geological time has so much more 
        to offer. A geology timeline covers the formation of our planet, moon, continents, oceans and Life with a capital L. 
        Geology forces us to zoom out and it reminds us that while we may think of ourselves as residents of our state, and the 
        legal or illegal citizens of our nation; we are in fact on a planet orbiting around the Sun.  So, strap in, because this 
        is going to get a little intense...in a purely academic way that is.   </p>

    <h1>The Precambrian Supereon  <em>4.54 bya - 541 mya</em></h1>

    <h2>Hadean <em>4.54 bya</em></h2>
    <article>
        <p>Our time traveling stroll down memory lane begins in a pretty rough place, the newly formed Earth. At this point in 
            time the surface of our planet was a molten, hot hell. So, we refer to this time as the Hadean after the molten, 
            hot hell of Greek mythology (Hades). Our side of the cosmos was still blowing off some steam from the busy work of 
            forming our solar system. Our little neighborhood in the Milky Way was little more than a planetary junkyard of 
            asteroids and unnamed space shrapnel, constantly crashing into each other with Star Wars explosions. Our planet was 
            just as much a part of that food chain. That's what planet forming is in the early stages, endless miles of debris. 
            Unclaimed by the gravity of planets or stars, asteroids just cruise through the Galaxy like sharks in the water. 
            So, our Earth at this point, having only recently swirled together from leftover Stardust, was this red-hot spinning 
            ball of molten rock. And it would pretty much stay that way thanks to relentless asteroid collisions. In fact, the 
            most epic collision may have formed our moon.  

            Making the moon... 
            
            It all began and ended when this mega, biggie-sized space rock the size of Mars named ‘Theia’ crossed orbital paths 
            and t-boned the ever-loving star dust out of the Earth. The two heavenly bodies hit so hard they essentially fused 
            together in the fray, ejecting molten rock and ash out into the void. Of course, this is outer space we’re talking 
            about where circular motion is king. The orbital forces of gravity cause any and everything to coalesce into spheres, 
            ellipses, and rings. Likewise, the mega-tons of leftover debris swirled and clumped together with the gravity provided 
            by the newborn Earth to form the glowing, dusty ball of ash we all know and love.  </p>
